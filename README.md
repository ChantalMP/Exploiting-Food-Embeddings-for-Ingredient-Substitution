# Exploiting-Food-Embeddings-for-Ingredient-Substitution
Official repository of the paper "Exploiting Food Embeddings for Ingredient Substitution".

Identifying ingredient substitutes for cooking recipes can be beneficial for various goals, such as nutrient opti- mization or avoiding allergens. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be valuable tools to make use of the vast cooking-related knowledge available online, and aid in finding ingredient alternatives. Despite previous approaches to identify ingredient substitutes, there is still a lack of research in this area regarding the most recent developments in the field of NLP. On top of that, a lack of standardized evaluation metrics makes comparing approaches difficult. In this paper, we present two models for ingredient embeddings, Food2Vec and FoodBERT. In addition, we combine both approaches with images, resulting in two multimodal repre- sentation models. FoodBERT is furthermore used for relation extraction. We conduct a ground truth based evaluation for all approaches, as well as a human evaluation. The comparison shows that FoodBERT, and especially the multimodal version, is best suited for substitute recommendations in dietary use cases.

### Installation:
1. Clone this repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ChantalMP/Exploiting-Food-Embeddings-for-Ingredient-Substitution
   ```
2. Install requirements:
   
   - Python 3.7 
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
3. Download data and models
    
    - Download https://github.com/ChantalMP/Exploiting-Food-Embeddings-for-Ingredient-Substitution/releases/download/0.1/food2vec_models.zip and place the content in ./food2vec/models
    - Download https://github.com/ChantalMP/Exploiting-Food-Embeddings-for-Ingredient-Substitution/releases/download/0.1/foodbert_data.zip and place the content in ./foodbert/data
    - Download https://github.com/ChantalMP/Exploiting-Food-Embeddings-for-Ingredient-Substitution/releases/download/0.1/foodbert_embeddings_data.zip and place the content in ./foodbert_embeddings/data
    - Download https://github.com/ChantalMP/Exploiting-Food-Embeddings-for-Ingredient-Substitution/releases/download/0.1/multimodal_data.zip and place the content in ./multimodal/data
    - Download https://github.com/ChantalMP/Exploiting-Food-Embeddings-for-Ingredient-Substitution/releases/download/0.1/relation_extraction_models.zip and place the content in ./relation_extraction/models
        
4. Optional: Generate data for FoodBERT and RE training
    - First get Recipe1m from http://im2recipe.csail.mit.edu/dataset/login/ (As of today correct link is: Layers (381 MiB))
    - Place it in ./data
    - run 
    ```
    python -m normalisation.normalize_recipe_instructions
    python -m foodbert.preprocess_instructions
    ```
   
   Only for RE training:
   - Sadly we can not publish the comment data needed for the relation extraction model
   - If you want to train or use the relation extraction model to generate substitutes you need to scrape comments yourself. The scripts for this are provided as is, but they are not maintained.
   - All scripts can be found in comment_scraping.
   
5. Evaluation:
   - We can't make our ground-truth publicly available, but if you want to reproduce our results or compare your own method, just drop us an email and we will send it to you.
